#Chef got in the trouble! He is the king of Chefland and Chessland. There is one queen in Chefland and one queen in Chessland and they both want a relationship with him. Chef is standing before a difficult choiceâ€¦
#
#Chessland may be considered a chessboard with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Let's denote a unit square in row r and column c by (r,c). Chef lives at square (X,Y) of this chessboard.
#
#Currently, both queens are living in Chessland too. Each queen, when alone on the chessboard, can see all squares that lie on the same row, column or diagonal as itself. A queen from (xq,yq) cannot see a square (r,c) if the square (X,Y) is strictly between them. Of course, if the queens can see each other, the kingdom will soon be in chaos!
#
#Help Chef calculate the number of possible configurations of the queens such that the kingdom will not be in chaos. A configuration is an unordered pair of distinct squares (xq1,yq1) and (xq2,yq2) such that neither of them is the square (X,Y). Two configurations are different if the position of queen 1 is different or the position of queen 2 is different.
