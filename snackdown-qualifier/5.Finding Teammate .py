#Snackdown 2019 is coming! Since Snackdown is a contest of teams with up to two members, everyone is looking for a teammate. There are N contestants (numbered 1 through N) who want to participate in Snackdown; let's denote the skill level of the i-th contestant by Si. These people want to pair up in N/2 teams; each team should consist of two people.
#
#Clearly everyone wishes for their teammate to be as skilled as possible, so everyone wants to maximize their teammate's skill level. We call a pairing (an unordered N/2-tuple of teams) valid if there are no two teams consisting of people (A,B) and (C,D) such that SD>SB and SA>SC â€” in that case, A and D would both prefer to be on the same team rather than with their current teammates.
#
#Find the number of valid pairings. Since this number can be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007.
